    <h1>Welcome to my homepage!</h1>

    <p>My name is Dat and I'm a web developer based in San Francisco. I specialize in front-end development and enjoy building responsive, user-friendly interfaces that engage and delight users. In my free time, I like to work on personal projects, go hiking, and practice my photography skills.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
 

    <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science and have been working in the tech industry for over 5 years. My passion for web development started when I was in college and has only grown stronger over time. I love the challenge of creating something from scratch and seeing it come to life in the browser.</p>
